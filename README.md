E-commerce Sales 
Objective: To Analyze e-commerce Amazon Data using python and MySQL for data analysis and Visualization

Key Findings
(a) Correlation between discount % and rating 
I found a weak negative correlation between discount percentage and rating (correlation coefficient: -0.1554). This suggests that higher discounts do not necessarily lead to better product ratings and might indicate that discounted products are not always of higher quality or are less appreciated by customers.

(b) Top Selling product Categories:The top 10 selling product categories based on the number of reviews are:

1. Computers Accessories | Accessories & Peripherals | Cables & Accessories | Cables | USB Cables - 233 reviews

2. Electronics | Home Theater - 162 reviews

3. Home & Kitchen | Heating - 116 reviews

4. Home & Kitchen | Kitchen & Home Appliances | Vacuum - 82 reviews

5. Electronics | Wearable Technology | Smart Watches - 76 reviews

6. Electronics | Mobiles & Accessories | Smartphones & Basic Mobiles | Smartphones - 68 reviews

7. Electronics | Headphones - 66 reviews

8. Computers & Accessories | Accessories & Peripherals | Keyboards - 60 reviews

9. Home & Kitchen | Kitchen & Home Appliances | Small Kitchen Appliances | Mixer Grinders - 27 reviews

10. Home & Kitchen | Kitchen & Home Appliances | Small Kitchen Appliances | Hand Blenders - 19 reviews


(c) Strategies to Improve Sales and Customer Engagement
1. Personalized Recommendations: Utilize customer data to provide personalized product recommendations based on their browsing and purchase history. This can increase customer satisfaction and the likelihood of purchase

2. Enhanced User Experience: Focus on improving the overall user experience on the e-commerce platform. Ensure easy navigation, quick checkout processes, and responsive customer support to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.

3. Promotional Campaigns: Plan targeted promotional campaigns during peak shopping seasons or holidays. Use the data to identify the best times and categories for these promotions to maximize their impact

4. Loyalty Programs: Implement reward programs to encourage repeat purchases and customer loyalty. Offer points for every purchase and review, which can be redeemed for discounts


(d)Anomalies or Patterns Found in the Data
Weak Negative Correlation: The weak negative correlation between discount percentage and rating (-0.1554) suggests that higher discounts do not necessarily lead to better product ratings. This indicates that customers might perceive heavily discounted products as lower quality or less valuable.

(e)Conclusions
1. Discount Strategy: Given the weak negative correlation between discounts and ratings, it's crucial to apply discounts strategically, focusing on well-received products to avoid devaluing the brand.

2. Customer Engagement: Personalized recommendations, loyalty programs, and well-timed promotional campaigns are key strategies to boost sales and customer engagement.

3. Data-Driven Decisions: Regular analysis of sales data is essential to identify trends, spot anomalies, and make informed business decisions.
